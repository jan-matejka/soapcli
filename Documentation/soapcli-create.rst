SYNOPSIS
========

soapcli create <binding>.<operation>

DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a request template for <operation> in <binding> and prints it to
stdout.

Technically, the template is created during ``man 1 soapcli-load`` but
that may change and soapcli-create may be wrapped with application
specific request creator, see ``man 1 soapcli-call``.
